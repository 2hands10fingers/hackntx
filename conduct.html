  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <h3 class="sub-head">By purchasing a ticket to a HackNTX event you agree to the following.</h3>
  <br />
  <p><strong>The Quick Version</strong></p>
  <p>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for 
    everyone, regardless of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>gender</li>
    <li>gender identity and expression</li>
    <li>age</li>
    <li>sexual orientation</li>
    <li>disability</li>
    <li>physical appearance</li>
    <li>body size</li>
    <li>race</li>
    <li>ethnicity</li>
    <li>nationality</li>
    <li>religion</li>
    <li>previous hackathon attendance or lack of</li>
    <li>computing experience or lack of</li>
    <li>chosen programming language or tech stack</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form.
    Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate at any hackathon venue,
    this includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hacks</li>
    <li>talks, presentations, or demos</li>
    <li>workshops</li>
    <li>any parties associated to the hackathon</li>
    <li>social media</li>
    <li>any other online media</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
    or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable)
    at the discretion of the hackathon organizers.</p>
  <p><strong>The Less Quick Version</strong></p>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
    identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual
    images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
    photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained
    disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
    unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
  <p>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable
    chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of
    their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take 
    photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of 
    privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <p>As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created 
    at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
  <p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. 
    In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, 
    or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) 
    should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise 
    create a sexualized environment.</p>
  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, 
    or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff 
    immediately.</p>
  <p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local 
    security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist 
    those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. 
    We value your attendance.</p>
  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers 
  may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, 
  expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their 
  behavior to local law enforcement.</p>
  <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues 
    and hackathon-related social events.</p>
